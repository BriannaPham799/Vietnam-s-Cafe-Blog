# Vietnam-s-Cafe-Blog

Vietnam is one of the most famous coffee-producing and consuming countries in Southeast Asia. Vietnamese coffee has a very special taste, which is a combination of strong flavour, mixed with a bit of bitterness. That combination will give the audience an unforgettable feeling.

Every morning, along the roads, you will easily see the image of people gathering at a small roadside shop to enjoy rustic cups of coffee. The image of small cafes crowded with people is a familiar image to the people here, and it is a unique feature that attracts many tourists everywhere. To bring people more information about the Vietnamese coffee experience, we are working on a web project called "Vietnam's Café Blog". Throughout this blog, we will introduce and bring users to many different cafes that not only have delicious coffees and drinks but also have beautiful views to enjoy while sipping the drink.

In this blog, we only focus on two large areas, Hanoi (the capital of Vietnam) and Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) – the two key economic areas of ​​Vietnam. These two cities are where users can easily find beautiful and unique cafes with delicious drinks.

Through the blog, we will also help users pick out the best coffee shops in both Hanoi and Saigon. Besides, to help users choose their drinks, we will also introduce drinks based on users’ preferences: coffee-based or non-coffee. This will make the experience of enjoying cafes in Vietnam more enjoyable and easier.
